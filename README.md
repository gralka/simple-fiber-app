# simple-fiber-app

This is (as the project title suggests) a simple [Fiber](https://github.org/gofiber/fiber) app.

The project was inspired by a lovely [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6NmSKSUj9g) by [Ben Davis](https://github.com/bmdavis419) found on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bmdavis419).

I am using this project to discover just how great Fiber really is, and I also practicing deploying projects similar to this one to production.
